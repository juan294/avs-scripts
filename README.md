# AVS Scripts

The AVS Scripts are meant to ease and automate configuring, building, and installing different versions of the AVS SDKs on the most common testing platforms (e.g. Raspbian, Ubuntu, and so on.) If you want a verbose, documented, and more readable version of the script refer to the Red Pill folder. If you just want to get the job done with the least amount of noise possible (or you know what you're doing), then feel free to go to the Blue Pill version.

Each script (Red Pill version only) will let you know in which platform and SDK version it has been successfully tested. I include specific information about the SoC, amount of memory, and OS version in which they have run successfully. 

If you find and issue or see any opportunity for improvement, well.. we're in GitHub. You know what to do :)

### To Keep in Mind

You still need to be familiar with the general instructions posted on the official developer documents. This is in no way a replacement of those resources.

### Security Best Practices and Important Considerations

All Alexa products should adopt the [Security Best Practices for Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa/alexa-voice-service/security-best-practices.html).

When building Alexa with the SDK, you should also adhere to the [following security principles](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa/avs-device-sdk/overview.html#security-best-practices).
